# s2e

A native Rust reference implementation for detecting gas flares and methane
plumes in Sentinel-2 imagery. Both modes share L1C scene search, CloudSEN masking
and georeferencing. Point and AOI runs default to both: a lit flare and an unlit
methane source are two states of the same facility.

There is no Python detector runtime. Candle loads the published MARS-S2L and
CloudSEN PyTorch checkpoints directly and verifies their pinned SHA-256 hashes.

This repository is the detector and nothing else. The machines it runs on belong
to [data-desk](https://github.com/data-desk-eco/data-desk) (`infra/fleet.sh`), and
the schedule on which they run belongs to
[etl](https://github.com/data-desk-eco/etl) (`s2e/`).

## Why L1C

L1C is canonical for both detectors. The original burnoff method preferred L1C
because atmospheric correction can clip the strongest SWIR thermal signal. The
later L2A path was an availability compromise for a public COG archive. CloudFerro
exposes L1C directly, so both modes now use it. `aws` and `cdse` retain L2A only as
explicit flare-comparison profiles.

## CLI

```bash
cargo build --release -p s2e-cli
target/release/s2e models

# Both signals, sharing one chip and CloudSEN pass.
target/release/s2e detect \
  --aoi aoi/uk-gas-import-terminals.geojson \
  --start 2026-01-01 --end 2026-07-17 --out out/uk

# Independent modes remain independently resumable.
target/release/s2e detect --mode plumes --bbox 53.79,39.35,53.81,39.37
target/release/s2e detect --mode flares --region 51.4,25.8,51.7,26.1

# Publish the canonical records unchanged. Turning them into Parquet is etl's
# job (`etl/providers/data-desk/s2e/views`), so there is no `views` subcommand here.
target/release/s2e archive --input out/uk --destination s3://bucket

# Derive a flare-site view for another date window.
target/release/s2e cluster \
  --archive 's3://bucket/detections/**/*.parquet' --out clusters.parquet
```

Sources are `aws-l1c` (default), `cdse-l1c`, `aws` and `cdse`. Fixed `--wind-u`
and `--wind-v` values make plume runs offline and reproducible; otherwise the
acquisition-hour GEOS-FP field is downloaded atomically into a bounded cache.
Background selection retains the published nearest-date, first-20-clear-scene
semantics while loading candidates in small parallel batches.

## Canonical records

The source of truth is a valid GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` for one detector,
target geometry, Sentinel-2 scene and methodology fingerprint:

```
out/observations/<area-hash>/<scene>/
  clouds-<method>.geojson
  flares-<method>.geojson
  plumes-<method>.geojson
out/assets/<area-hash>/<scene>/
  plumes-<method>.tif                 # positive probability raster, when present
```

Each collection carries the original AOI geometry and properties, requested and
processed footprints, scene/source metadata, model or threshold fingerprint and
analysis status. `features` contains zero or more spatial detections; an empty
array is a successful negative observation. Multiple connected plume components
are separate features with independently calculated flux and uncertainty.

Detector records are deliberately independent. A flare-only run never updates a
plume result, and a later plume run never rewrites the flare record. A changed
methodology gets a new deterministic filename; retrying the same methodology
idempotently commits the same path. Combined runs share computation in memory but
retain this clean persistence boundary.

`archive` copies GeoJSON and raster assets unchanged. The records stop there: the
DuckDB transforms that rebuild `data-desk/detections/`, private
`ops/data-desk/clouds/`, and `data-desk/retrievals/` live in the ETL repository
(`etl/providers/data-desk/s2e/sql`), because they are a
property of how the archive is published rather than of how detection works.
`clusters/` is derived by `cluster`; none of the Parquet products is another
authoritative detection format.

## Validation

- Native MARS-S2L probability agrees with published PyTorch inference within
  `2e-5` on the parity fixture; CloudSEN produces the same class map.
- On known plume `T_EMIT_227` (2024-10-25), Rust reproduces the published score and
  background; flux differs by 0.17% and uncertainty by 0.4%.
- Over the known Ras Laffan archive, strict L1C found 49 scene detections versus
  45 for L2A while both resolve the same 16 persistent sites.

```bash
cargo test -p s2e-core -p s2e-cli -p s2e-wasm --no-default-features
```

## Running at scale

Bulk runs happen on a CloudFerro fleet in WAW3-2, next to the Copernicus archive.
Nothing about that fleet lives here. A tagged release publishes a Linux binary to
the archive, and the `etl` repo fetches it, spreads it over as many boxes as it wants
and runs it:

```bash
make s2e-aoi NAME=lng AOI='kind=lng_terminal,status=operating'
make s2e-run NAME=lng ARGS="--start 2026-01-01 --end 2026-07-17"
```

Three flags are what make that possible, and they are the only concession this CLI
makes to being run by something else:

- `--shard I/N` takes member `I` of an N-way split of `--aoi`, so every box works a
  balanced slice of one shared file and no orchestrator has to cut it up.
- `verify` proves a run is complete — every requested feature has a durable record,
  no retryable `.err` is left — and exits non-zero if it is not.
- `coverage` merges the scanned AOI into the map's published coverage overlay.

Each of these needs to know how a record is laid out and how a feature is named, so
each belongs here rather than in a shell script somewhere else.

The optional GPU reader is a development box rather than a fleet, since it needs a
`--features gpu` build from source. `gpu/cloud-init.yaml` is its recipe:

```bash
FLEET_NAME=s2e-gpu FLEET=1 CF_FLAVOR=vm.l40s.1 FLEET_OS='Ubuntu 22.04 NVIDIA' \
  CF_USERDATA=$PWD/gpu/cloud-init.yaml ~/data-desk/infra/fleet.sh up
```

Then run the parity gate on it — nvJPEG2000 against GDAL/OpenJPEG over real scenes,
which must agree byte for byte:

```bash
S2_PARITY_BBOX=W,S,E,N cargo test --release -p s2e-cli --features gpu parity -- --ignored --nocapture
```
